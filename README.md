# OpenFisca Aotearoa

## Writing the Legislation

Aotearoa New Zealandâ€™s legislation as code project, utilising OpenFisca.

Source code hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/ServiceInnovationLab/openfisca-aotearoa/)

Please also read [the wiki](https://github.com/ServiceInnovationLab/openfisca-aotearoa/wiki) as a way of introduction.

## Install Instructions for Users and Contributors

This package requires [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) .

Supported platforms:
- GNU/Linux distributions (in particular Debian and Ubuntu);
- Mac OS X;
- Microsoft Windows (we recommend using [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) instead of the default console).

Other OS should work if they can execute Python and NumPy.

The files that are outside from the `openfisca_aotearoa` folder are used to set up the development environment.

### Setting-up a Virtual Environment with Pew

We recommend using a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (abbreviated as "virtualenv") with a virtualenv manager such as [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew).

- A [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is a project specific environment created to suit the needs of the project you are working on.
- A virtualenv manager, such as [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew), lets you easily create, remove and toggle between several virtualenvs.

To install pew, launch a terminal on your computer and follow these instructions:

```sh
python --version # You should have python 2.7.9 or better installed on your computer.
# If not, visit http://www.python.org to install it and install pip as well.
```

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pew  # if asked, answer "Y" to the question about modifying your shell config file.
```
To set-up and create a new a virtualenv named **openfisca** running python2.7:

```sh
pew new openfisca --python=python2.7
```
(Windows users should use the following)
```sh
pew new openfisca --python=2.7
```

The virtualenv you just created will be automatically activated. This means you will operate in the virtualenv immediately. You should see a prompt resembling this:
```sh
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
Launching subshell in virtual environment. Type 'exit' or 'Ctrl+D' to return.
```
Additional information:
- Exit the virtualenv with `exit` (or Ctrl-D).
- Re-enter with `pew workon openfisca`.

## Serve OpenFisca Aotearoa with the OpenFisca Web API

If you are considering building a web application, you can use the packaged OpenFisca Web API.

To serve the Openfisca Web API locally, run:

```sh
openfisca serve --port 5000
```

To read more about the `openfisca serve` command, check out its [documentation](https://openfisca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openfisca_serve.html).

You can make sure that your instance of the API is working by requesting:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:5000/spec"
```

This endpoint returns the [Open API specification](https://www.openapis.org/) of your API.

:tada: OpenFisca Aotearoa is now served by the OpenFisca Web API! To learn more, go to the [OpenFisca Web API documentation](https://openfisca.org/doc/openfisca-web-api/index.html)
