        (1) The basic qualifications for entitlement to a young parent payment are in subsection (2). The qualifications for a single person are in section 165.
            The qualifications for a young person who is or has been married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are in section 166.

        (2) <--  snip - see social_security__meets_young_parent_payment_basic_requirements -->

        (3) Nothing in subsection (2)﻿(e) affects the entitlement of a young person to receive a young parent payment if, during a temporary period, the person
            has income sufficient to fully abate the payment but the person otherwise fulfils the conditions of entitlement to the payment.
        (4) For the purposes of subsection (2)﻿(b), a dependent child of a young person who is married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship must
            also be treated as a dependent child of the young person’s spouse or partner.
