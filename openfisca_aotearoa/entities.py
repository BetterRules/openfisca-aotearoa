    Propertee is an example of a group entity.
    A group entity contains one or more individualÂ·s.
    Each individual in a group entity has a role (e.g. rate payer, owner, resident). Some roles can only be held by a limited number of individuals (e.g. a 'first_parent' can only be held by one individual), while others can have an unlimited number of individuals (e.g. 'children').

    Example:
    Propertee variables (e.g. properties rates') are usually defined for a group entity such as 'Propertee'.

    Usage:
    Check the number of individuals of a specific role (e.g. check if there is a 'rate_payer'  properties.nb_persons(Propertee.RATE_PAYER)).
    Calculate a variable applied to each individual of the group entity (e.g. calculate the 'salary' of each member of the 'Property' with salaries = properties.members('salary', period = MONTH); sum_salaries = properties.sum(salaries)).

    A Person represents an individual, the minimal legal entity on which a legislation might be applied.

    Example:
    The 'salary' and 'income_tax' variables are usually defined for the entity 'Person'.

    Usage:
    Calculate a variable applied to a 'Person' (e.g. access the 'salary' of a specific month with person('salary', "2017-05")).
    Check the role of a 'Person' in a group entity (e.g. check if a the 'Person' is a 'first_parent' in a 'Property' entity with person.has_role(Property.FIRST_PARENT)).
